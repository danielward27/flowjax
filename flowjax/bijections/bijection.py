"""Abstact base classes for the `Bijection` and `Bijection` types.

Note when implementing bijections, by convention we try to i) implement the "transform"
methods as the faster/more intuitive approach (compared to the inverse methods); and ii)
implement only the forward methods if an inverse is not available. The `Invert`
bijection can be used to invert the orientation if a fast inverse is desired (e.g.
maximum likelihood fitting of flows).

class AbstractBijection(eqx.Module):
    """Bijection abstract class.

    Similar to :py:class:`~flowjax.distributions.AbstractDistribution`, bijections have
    a ``shape`` and a ``cond_shape`` attribute. To allow easy composing of bijections,
    all bijections support passing of conditioning variables (even if ignored).

    Bijections are registered as Jax PyTrees (as they are equinox modules), so are
    compatible with normal JAX operations. The methods of bijections do not support
    passing of additional batch dimensions, however, ``jax.vmap`` or ``eqx.filter_vmap``
    can be used to vmap specific methods if desired, and a bijection can be explicitly
    vectorised using the :class:`~flowjax.bijections.jax_transforms.Vmap` bijection.

    Implementing a bijection:

    - Inherit from ``AbstractBijection``.
    - Define the attributes ``shape`` and ``cond_shape``. A ``cond_shape`` of
      ``None`` is used to represent unconditional bijections.
    - Implement the abstract methods ``transform``, ``transform_and_log_det``,
      ``inverse`` and ``inverse_and_log_det``. These should act on
      inputs compatible with the shapes ``shape`` for ``x``, and ``cond_shape``
      for ``condition``.
