        optimizer: Optax optimizer. Defaults to None.
        condition: Conditioning variables. Defaults to None.
        loss_fn: Loss function. Defaults to MaximumLikelihoodLoss.
        max_epochs: Maximum number of epochs. Defaults to 100.
        max_patience: Number of consecutive epochs with no validation loss improvement
            after which training is terminated. Defaults to 5.
        batch_size: Batch size. Defaults to 100.
